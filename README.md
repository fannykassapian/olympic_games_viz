## 3. Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to explore the data and produce some visualizations that give some insight about the history of the Olympic Games. 

More specifically, it explores the share of women athletes, the number of medals won per country, the representation of each country (and the impact of historical events), the participation of Individual Olympic Athletes, and the popularity of sports in each country.
